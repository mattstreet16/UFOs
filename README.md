# UFOs
#### Using Javascript and HTML to display UFO sightings.

## Overview
  Dana, a close friend and data journalist has asked me to help her find a way to share and display a javascript file containing hundreds of UFO sightings in a neat and organized Html indexfile so she can use for her next written report. After Dana sent me the data, I wrote an app.js file that would read the data convert it to a neat table and then used that to help me create an index.html file that would display the data.
## Results 
I created the webpage

Using the data I was provided I created a table

And allowed the table to be filtered by multiple aspects:

## Summary
In summation, the webpage I created will work for Dana, however there are some draw backs. For one this webpage uses one source of data and there are likely more sightings than we have listed, and lastly, the filters are to specific to the dataset even down to the letter casing. If you type TX instead of tx the filters wont work. Other than that the page is fuctional and it was fun to help Dana.
